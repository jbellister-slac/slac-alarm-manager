# SLAC Alarm Manager

The SLAC Alarm Manager contains two main ways of interfacing with the [NALMS](https://slaclab.github.io/nalms/) alarm
system. There is a standalone python application for viewing and interacting with alarms descibed in greater
detail [here](app.md). And a PyDM data plugin that will allow for building displays containing
summary alarms as described [here](pydm.md).
